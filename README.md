Description:
This repository contains a fake news detection project developed for the GEN AI course NLP assignment. The project classifies news articles as fake or real using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. It uses Logistic Regression with the Kaggle Fake and Real News Dataset, achieving approximately 92% accuracy. The implementation is inspired by advanced workflows for clickbait and fake news article detection from a downloaded project, adapted for simplicity and accessibility.
